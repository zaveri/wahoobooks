ChucksList v0.1 Release Notes - April 8, 2008
---------------------------------------------

Kevin and I have been working on ChucksList in our spare time for a couple months now.  However, neither of us have deployed it and actively used it on a site yet.

In the spirit of releasing early and releasing often, it is time to get our first release out into the wild and get some real world feedback.

Here are some of the features that we have integrated into v0.1:
1. ability to post ads with just an e-mail address (and email verification), no login required
2. email forwarding/redirection, so responses get redirected through a @chuckslist.org email address
3. site wide RSS feed
4. full admin interface
5. full list of categories and parent categories in YAML format, you can import the whole list easily

Please check out ChucksList and give us some feedback.  If you get it deployed somewhere, send us the link.

Thanks, and enjoy!
